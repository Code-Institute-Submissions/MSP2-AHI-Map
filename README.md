## UX
### User stories
As a staff member, I expect to be able to interact with the map and assist callers with finding AHI approved trained veterinary practitioner in their area.
As a member of the general public, I expect to be able to find an AHI approved trained veterinary practitioner in my area.
As a trained veterinary practitioner, I expect to see my correct contact details and areas trained on the map for my clients to contact me. 
### Strategy
The goal of this page is to make it as easy as possible for farmers to find AHI approved trained veterinary practitioner in their area.
### Scope
This page will be aimed for farmers and vets specifically and therefore I want to make it as easy to follow as possible and to make the data clear and easy to read. 
### Structure
This standalone page will contain a search section with results section and a map section. This page will be on broken into two sections. Section one will be search and results which will be on a grey background and the second section will be a full sized map zoom to Ireland. 
### Skeleton
Desktop and mobile wireframes have been created – click here. 
Surface
The background of the page is white with the search section in grey to provide section definition.
### Technologies
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JavaScript
•	Bootstrap (4.4.1)
•	Google Map API

### Features
The widget has a dropdown option set, when a selection is made, JavaScript function zooms to that set area on the map.  A JavaScript function also returns the associated list of map marker results for that area. The markers all contain info windows that when clicked shows the name of practice associated with that marker. 
Features Left to Implement
A feature I have left to implement is that if the user clicks on a result the associated map marker will bounce on the map to identify itself.  Another feature I would like to implement is an additional filter by the programme area the practice is trained in.
